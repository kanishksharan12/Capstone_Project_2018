# Capstone_Project_2018
This capstone project is aimed at pursuing opportunities in computer forensics domain, focusing mainly on Linux distributions. The project will discuss and demonstrate detailed steps of automating manual forensics on every aspect Linux operating systems using command line only. This project will fill the gap between existing not so user-friendly command line forensic and analysis tools and GUI (Graphical User Interface) forensic tools. Most Linux servers do not support GUI applications, and hence, professionals rely on manual command line tools to get the job done. The primary endeavor of this project is to maximize automation of command line forensic tasks so that the subsequent analysis becomes considerably more straightforward. This project will automate tasks using well-constructed shell and python scripts. Since information analysis cannot be automated as it is a manual process this project will present the data in its simplified form that will significantly simplify the process of manual analysis.
